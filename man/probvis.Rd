\arguments{
    \item{classed}{A data frame where each row represents the probability for given a sample to fit each of the four classes as well as its overall classification based on the chosen thresholds.}
}
\value{Plots a stacked bar chart depicting the probabilities a given sample has of being classified for each class (hence the sum is always 1.0)}
